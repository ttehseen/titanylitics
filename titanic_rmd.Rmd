## R Markdown

The data has been divided into two datasets; the training data and the testing data in order to see whether our ML learning models accurately predict the fatality rate. We will start defining a few plausible models using the training data and test this data to get a score and finally see which model is the most accurate.

###1 Complete fatality:

In this model we predict that everyone dies. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
